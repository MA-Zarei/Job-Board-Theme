Description: A responsive and custom WordPress theme developed for a job board website. It includes a homepage listing all job posts, single job detail pages, login and registration pages with role-based access, and custom dashboards for employers and jobseekers. Two custom user roles are defined: 'employer' and 'jobseeker'. Two custom post types are used: 'job' for job listings and 'job_application' for managing applications. All post types include custom fields created with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF). Employers can post jobs with fields like job category, location, contract type, experience, salary, education level, military status, and more. Jobseekers can apply to jobs and upload their resume. Each application contains fields such as the related job, resume file, jobseeker ID, status, employer note, and submission date. Custom profile fields are also added for both employers (e.g. contact number, company address, logo) and jobseekers (e.g. contact number).
